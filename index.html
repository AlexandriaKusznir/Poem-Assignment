        <h1>A Mistake </h1>
            <p> Standing proudly, smiling brightly <br> Not letting the mask slip, not even for a moment <br> Knowing everyone's <strong> eyes </strong> are on me <br> Watching my <strong> every </strong> move. <br> <em> Judging me harshly, </em> <br> It's something I know so well <br> Since I'm center staged, all lights on me <br> Blinding me, making me feel so <em> weak </em> <br> Need to live up to expectations <br> <em> All it takes is one mistake... and you're left in the dust... </em> </p>
